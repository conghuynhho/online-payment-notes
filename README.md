# Zindi Mobile Money And Financial Inclusion in Tanzania Challenge

This repo attempts to provide a framework for the task of classifying an individual into one of four categories based on mobile money and financial service use. I test the approach using Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers and evaluate their performance on a dataset provided by [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/mobile-money-and-financial-inclusion-in-tanzania-challenge) containing socio-economic and demographic information on approximately 7,100 individuals across Tanzania.
